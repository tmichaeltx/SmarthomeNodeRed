This says the subflow will be trying to load the table from Google sheets under the expectation that either this is the first time a lookup has been tried an the data had not yet been cached in the global variable or potentially the data in the cache has become stale and reloading from the Google sheet will add a row that will match the requested search criteria.\n### Output 3: Error despite having tried to reload from data source\nFor the subflow, this output is used when either the global variable to contain the data table either does no exist or does not contain a row with all of the requested search criteria and at least 1 attempt has already been made to reload the global vairable cache. This is effectively a notification of non-recoverable lookup failure.","category":"Mike Subflows","in":[{"x":50,"y":80,"wires":[{"id":"2c0f2be7.ed2b94"}]}],"out":[{"x":480,"y":67,"wires":[{"id":"2c0f2be7.ed2b94","port":0}]},{"x":540,"y":79,"wires":[{"id":"2c0f2be7.ed2b94","port":1}]},{"x":600,"y":91,"wires":[{"id":"2c0f2be7.ed2b94","port":2}]}],"env":[],"color":"#FDF0C2","inputLabels":["Info for Lookup"],"outputLabels":["Value Found","Error but try reloading from data source","Error despite having tried to reload from data source"]},{"id":"3bfce36.77ec51c","type":"subflow","name":"Read Spreadsheet For Details (final 6/2?)

This is by default false. If it is true, it builds the outputs from the following inputs:\n - msg.SpreadsheetID\n - msg.Tab\n - msg.ColStart\n - msg.MinRow\n - msg.ColEnd\n - msg.MaxRow\n\nAssuming the first was false, it checks the boolean value of the **msg.IgnoreEnvVar** value.

If it is true, it builds the outputs from the following inputs:\n - msg.SpreadsheetID\n - msg.Tab\n - msg.ColStart\n - msg.MinRow\n - msg.ColEnd\n - msg.MaxRow\n\nAssuming both are false, then it can build the outputs based on the subflows environment variables.

They are:\n * **OverrideEnvVariables** - This one looks at the environment variable that was set in the flow triggering the subflow\n * **msg.IgnoreEnvVar** - This one is allows the logic to be driven by a message object property and thus can be set at runtime or earlier in the flow based on upstream logic\n\nFirst it checks the boolean value of the **OverrideEnvVariables** environment variable. This is by default false. If it is true, it builds the outputs from the following inputs:\n - msg.SpreadsheetID\n - msg.Tab\n - msg.ColStart\n - msg.MinRow\n - msg.ColEnd\n - msg.MaxRow\n\nAssuming the first was false, it checks the boolean value of the **msg.IgnoreEnvVar** value. This will evaluated as false if not populated, so sending false is unnecessary. If it is true, it builds the outputs from the following inputs:\n - msg.SpreadsheetID\n - msg.Tab\n - msg.ColStart\n - msg.MinRow\n - msg.ColEnd\n - msg.MaxRow\n\nAssuming both are false, then it can build the outputs based on the subflows environment variables. These can either be those set in the calling flow or they may be the default ones built into the subflow.\n\nRegardless of the method used to build the output, the node also removes the input message properties.\n\n\n\nmsg.IgnoreEnvVar"},{"id":"603c205a.b0331","type":"GSheet","z":"c5ccb11d.87221","creds":"adb4e9b8.8beee8","method":"get","action":"","sheet":"","cells":"","name":"Read Input from GSheet","x":610,"y":20,"wires":[["dbd52898.8d0788"]],"info":"Use the GSheet node to get the a set of rows from a google spreadsheet.\n\n# **Inputs**\n### **creds**\nThis is the name on the gauth configuration node.

inputs to the GSheet node.\nThe outputs that make up those inputs are:\n - msg.sheet -the long spreadsheet identifier that can be pulled from the spreadsheet's URL when editing it using Google Sheets.\n - msg.topic - the combination of spreadsheet tab and cell range\n## Note\nThere are 2 very similar booleans evaluated by this node. They are:\n * **OverrideEnvVariables** - This one looks at the environment variable that was set in the flow triggering the subflow\n * **msg.IgnoreEnvVar** - This one is allows the logic to be driven by a message object property and thus can be set at runtime or earlier in the flow based on upstream logic\n\nFirst it checks the boolean value of the **OverrideEnvVariables** environment variable. This is by default false. If it is true, it builds the outputs from the following inputs:\n - msg.SpreadsheetID\n - msg.Tab\n - msg.ColStart\n - msg.MinRow\n - msg.ColEnd\n - msg.MaxRow\n\nAssuming the first was false, it checks the boolean value of the **msg.IgnoreEnvVar** value. This will evaluated as false if not populated, so sending false is unnecessary. If it is true, it builds the outputs from the following inputs:\n - msg.SpreadsheetID\n - msg.Tab\n - msg.ColStart\n - msg.MinRow\n - msg.ColEnd\n - msg.MaxRow\n\nAssuming both are false, then it can build the outputs based on the subflows environment variables. These can either be those set in the calling flow or they may be the default ones built into the subflow.\n\nRegardless of the method used to build the output, the node also removes the input message properties.\n\n\n\nmsg.IgnoreEnvVar"},{"id":"d5c913da.267c4","type":"GSheet","z":"d663491c.25a828","creds":"adb4e9b8.8beee8","method":"get","action":"","sheet":"","cells":"","name":"Read Input from GSheet","x":610,"y":20,"wires":[["f99ba293.afaa9"]],"info":"Use the GSheet node to get the a set of rows from a google spreadsheet.\n\n# **Inputs**\n### **creds**\nThis is the name on the gauth configuration node.

Normally it is used to trigger loading the table from Google sheets under the expectation that either this is the first time a lookup has been tried an the data had not yet been cached in the global variable or potentially the data in the cache has become stale and reloading from the Google sheet will add a row that will match the requested search criteria.\n### Output 3: Error despite having tried to reload from data source\nThis output is used when either the global variable to contain the data table either does no exist or does not contain a row with all of the requested search criteria and at least 1 attempt has already been made to reload the global vairable cache.

The data is arrayed with the first row being column headers describing the data in those columns in subsequent rows.\n## **inputs**\n### globalsource \nThe name of the global variable holding the table of data\n### msg.keyvalues\nThese components of the msg object are made up of key value pairs used to identify the row of data. The key corresponds to the column header identifying the column to look in and the value corresponds to what data value in that column qualifies as a matching row.\n### msg.searchfor\nThese components of the msg object are made up of key value pairs used to retrieve the missing data. The key corresponds to the column header identifying the column to look in. The value enters the node empty.\n## **outputs**\n### Output1: Value Found \nThis ouput is used when the node has successfully identified the requested data. That data is placed into the value portions of the key value pairs that made up the msg.searchfor input\n### Output 2: Error but try reloading from data source\nThis output is used when either the global variable to contain the data table either does no exist or does not contain a row with all of the requested search criteria. Normally it is used to trigger loading the table from Google sheets under the expectation that either this is the first time a lookup has been tried an the data had not yet been cached in the global variable or potentially the data in the cache has become stale and reloading from the Google sheet will add a row that will match the requested search criteria.\n### Output 3: Error despite having tried to reload from data source\nThis output is used when either the global variable to contain the data table either does no exist or does not contain a row with all of the requested search criteria and at least 1 attempt has already been made to reload the global vairable cache. This is effectively a notification of non-recoverable lookup failure."},{"id":"f6f6594.f50eda8","type":"catch","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"","scope":["a0879f53.f0f19"],"uncaught":false,"x":130,"y":440,"wires":[["31dc779f.ffa658"]]},{"id":"b1f01095.12cba","type":"debug","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Otherwise Failure","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"true","targetType":"full","x":470,"y":540,"wires":[]},{"id":"31dc779f.ffa658","type":"switch","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"","property":"error.message","propertyType":"msg","rules":[{"t":"eq","v":"Reload from Google Sheet","vt":"str"},{"t":"eq","v":"Stop Loop","vt":"str"},{"t":"else"}],"checkall":"true","repair":false,"outputs":3,"x":290,"y":460,"wires":[["1d41af0f.d8ef61","4b260afa.ac1754"],["65dfe48d.89207c"],[]]},{"id":"65dfe48d.89207c","type":"debug","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Stop Loop Failure","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"true","targetType":"full","x":470,"y":500,"wires":[]},{"id":"4b260afa.ac1754","type":"debug","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Load Cache from Spreadseet Failure","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"true","targetType":"full","x":530,"y":460,"wires":[]},{"id":"1d41af0f.d8ef61","type":"link out","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Load Cache from Spreadsheet","links":["d53dfbe4.293a48"],"x":550,"y":420,"wires":[],"l":true},{"id":"d53dfbe4.293a48","type":"link in","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Load Cache from Spreadsheet","links":["1d41af0f.d8ef61"],"x":250,"y":1500,"wires":[["c49b85ac.541a88","7011c933.90e458"]],"l":true},{"id":"c49b85ac.541a88","type":"change","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Increment flow.QueueCounter","rules":[{"t":"set","p":"QueueCounter","pt":"flow","to":"$flowContext(\"QueueCounter\") + 1","tot":"jsonata"}],"action":"","property":"","from":"","to":"","reg":false,"x":590,"y":1400,"wires":[["bbaa25c0.ae1ae8","92f8750e.77e398"]]},{"id":"bbaa25c0.ae1ae8","type":"q-gate","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"q-gate","controlTopic":"control","defaultState":"queueing","openCmd":"open","closeCmd":"close","toggleCmd":"toggle","queueCmd":"queue","defaultCmd":"default","triggerCmd":"trigger","flushCmd":"flush","resetCmd":"reset","peekCmd":"peek","dropCmd":"drop","statusCmd":"status","maxQueueLength":"100","keepNewest":false,"qToggle":false,"persist":false,"x":790,"y":1460,"wires":[["44769477.49a0bc"]]},{"id":"44769477.49a0bc","type":"change","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Decrement flow.QueueCounter","rules":[{"t":"set","p":"QueueCounter","pt":"flow","to":"$flowContext(\"QueueCounter\") - 1","tot":"jsonata"}],"action":"","property":"","from":"","to":"","reg":false,"x":990,"y":1400,"wires":[["f8006a98.d72938"]]},{"id":"7011c933.90e458","type":"rbe","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Limit output to 1 msg per error.message","func":"rbe","gap":"","start":"","inout":"out","property":"error.message","x":600,"y":1620,"wires":[["e2faab60.257a38"]]},{"id":"e2faab60.257a38","type":"switch","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Check if Device is a reset and thus no processing is needed","property":"error.message","propertyType":"msg","rules":[{"t":"eq","v":"Reset","vt":"str"},{"t":"else"}],"checkall":"true","repair":false,"outputs":2,"x":660,"y":1660,"wires":[[],["fb2f7a54.c56b58"]],"outputLabels":["Yes","No"]},{"id":"fb2f7a54.c56b58","type":"change","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Increment flow.LCFSCounter","rules":[{"t":"set","p":"LCFSCounter","pt":"flow","to":"$flowContext(\"LCFSCounter\") + 1","tot":"jsonata"},{"t":"set","p":"payload","pt":"msg","to":"LCFSCounter","tot":"flow"}],"action":"","property":"","from":"","to":"","reg":false,"x":1040,"y":1660,"wires":[["a3b07a23.464448"]]},{"id":"a3b07a23.464448","type":"function","z":"542f8cf0.3c1ce4","name":"Create spreadsheet range and put into msg.topic","func":"//Put inputs and read values into msg properties to be visible downstream\nmsg.sheet = msg.SpreadsheetID;\nmsg.tab = msg.Tab;\nmsg.cellstart = msg.ColStart + msg.MinRow;\nmsg.cellend = msg.ColEnd + msg.MaxRow;\nmsg.targetrange = msg.tab+\"!\"+msg.cellstart+\":\"+msg.cellend\nmsg.topic = msg.targetrange\ndelete msg.Tab\ndelete msg.SpreadsheetID\ndelete msg.ColEnd\ndelete msg.MaxRow\ndelete msg.IgnoreEnvVar\ndelete msg.tab\ndelete msg.cellstart\ndelete msg.cellend\ndelete msg.targetrange\nreturn msg;","outputs":1,"noerr":0,"x":1100,"y":1700,"wires":[["e5f9bbf9.4aae68"]],"info":"This node sets up the inputs to the GSheet node.\nThe outputs that make up those inputs are:\n - msg.sheet -the long spreadsheet identifier that can be pulled from the spreadsheet's URL when editing it using Google Sheets.\n - msg.topic - the combination of spreadsheet tab and cell range\n## Note\nThere are 2 very similar booleans evaluated by this node.

The data is arrayed with the first row being column headers describing the data in those columns in subsequent rows.\n## **inputs**\n### globalsource \nThe name of the global variable holding the table of data\n### msg.keyvalues\nThese components of the msg object are made up of key value pairs used to identify the row of data. The key corresponds to the column header identifying the column to look in and the value corresponds to what data value in that column qualifies as a matching row.\n### msg.searchfor\nThese components of the msg object are made up of key value pairs used to retrieve the missing data. The key corresponds to the column header identifying the column to look in. The value enters the node empty.\n## **outputs**\n### Output1: Value Found \nThis ouput is used when the node has successfully identified the requested data.

Normally it is used to trigger loading the table from Google sheets under the expectation that either this is the first time a lookup has been tried an the data had not yet been cached in the global variable or potentially the data in the cache has become stale and reloading from the Google sheet will add a row that will match the requested search criteria.\n### Output 3: Error despite having tried to reload from data source\nThis output is used when either the global variable to contain the data table either does no exist or does not contain a row with all of the requested search criteria and at least 1 attempt has already been made to reload the global vairable cache.

Normally it is used to trigger loading the table from Google sheets under the expectation that either this is the first time a lookup has been tried an the data had not yet been cached in the global variable or potentially the data in the cache has become stale and reloading from the Google sheet will add a row that will match the requested search criteria.\n### Output 3: Error despite having tried to reload from data source\nThis output is used when either the global variable to contain the data table either does no exist or does not contain a row with all of the requested search criteria and at least 1 attempt has already been made to reload the global vairable cache.
